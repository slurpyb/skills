title: "Nested Styles"
---

Panda provides different ways of nesting style declarations. You can use the native css nesting syntax, or the built-in
pseudo props like `_hover` and `_focus`. Pseudo props are covered more in-depth in the next section.

### Native CSS Nesting

Panda supports the native css nesting syntax. You can use the `&` selector to create nested styles.

> **Important:** It is required to use the "&" character when nesting styles.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    '&:hover': {
      bg: 'orange.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```

You can also target children and siblings using the `&` syntax.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    '& span': {
      color: 'pink.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```

We recommend not using descendant selectors as they can lead to specificity issues when managing style overrides.
Colocating styles directly on the element is the preferred way of writing styles in Panda.

### Using Pseudo Props

Panda provides a set of pseudo props that can be used to create nested styles. The pseudo props are prefixed with an
underscore `_` to avoid conflicts with the native pseudo selectors.

For example, to create a hover style, you can use the `_hover` pseudo prop.

```jsx
<div
  className={css({
    bg: 'red.400',
    _hover: {
      bg: 'orange.400'
    }
  })}
/>
```
