# Knowledge-Type Skill Template

**Purpose**: Provide background knowledge for agents.

**Frontmatter Requirements**:
```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: Provides [knowledge type] for [domain/purpose]
user-invocable: false
---
```

**Writing Style Requirements**:
- Use declarative voice: "Skills are...", "Components provide...", "Use when..."
- Never use imperative commands: avoid "Load", "Create", "Execute"

**Structure Requirements**:
- Topic-based sections: "## Core Concepts", "## Best Practices", "## Patterns"
- Use reference tables, definitions, rule lists
- Include examples illustrating concepts (not action steps)
- Keep under 200 lines; use `references/` for detailed content

**Complete Template**:
```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Provides [knowledge type] for [domain/purpose]
user-invocable: false
---

## Validation Checklist for Skills

- [ ] Frontmatter `user-invocable` matches content style (imperative vs declarative)
- [ ] plugin.json declaration matches type (commands vs skills array)
- [ ] Content follows appropriate template structure (phases vs topics)
- [ ] Writing style consistent throughout (imperative vs declarative)
- [ ] All paths use correct format (relative `./` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`)
- [ ] Bash tool restrictions present in allowed-tools (never bare `Bash`)
