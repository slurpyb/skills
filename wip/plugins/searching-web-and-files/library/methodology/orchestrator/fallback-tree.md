# Procedural Fallback Tree: Orchestrator Routing

## 1. Ambiguous Routing Signal
If the user's prompt (e.g., "Fix it") does not map cleanly to Research (Pattern 1), Review (Pattern 2), Execution (Pattern 3), or Parallelism (Pattern 4):
- **Action**: Do not guess. Default to Pattern 1 (Learning Loop) to synthesize the requirement. Ask the user 1 clarifying question to determine if code execution or review is actually needed.

## 2. Inner Loop Crashes (Timeout/Dependency)
If the delegated inner loop (whether dual-loop or swarm) crashes abruptly without returning a completed artifact or a status:
- **Action**: The Orchestrator reclaims control. It does NOT enter an infinite wait. It assesses the terminal output or log of the crash, generates a Correction Packet containing the crash trace, and attempts to re-delegate.

## 3. Sub-Agent Process Fails to Start
If `agent_orchestrator.py` or the environment fails to spawn the requested CLI subagent:
- **Action**: Present the generated Task Packet to the user directly in chat. Ask the user to instantiate the environment (e.g., another terminal window) and act as the bridge manually. 

## 4. Retrospective Cannot Be Generated
If the loop completes but the friction logs are empty or the agent lacks memory of what actually happened during the execution:
- **Action**: Generate an explicit 'Null Retrospective' noting that execution traces were lost. Prompt the user to confirm closure before passing control to the Primary Agent for the seal sequence.
