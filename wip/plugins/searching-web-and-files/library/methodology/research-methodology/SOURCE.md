# Research Methodology

> **Quick Guide:** Investigation flow is Glob -> Grep -> Read. All claims require file:line evidence. Structured output format for AI consumption. Read-only operations only. Verify every path before reporting.

- [reference.md](reference.md) - Decision frameworks, anti-patterns, quality checklist

<critical_requirements>

## CRITICAL: Before Any Research

> **All research must be evidence-based with file:line references**

**(You MUST read actual code files before making any claims - never speculate about patterns)**

**(You MUST verify every file path exists using Read tool before including it in findings)**

**(You MUST include file:line references for all pattern claims)**

**(You MUST NOT attempt to write or edit any files - you are read-only)**

**(You MUST produce structured, AI-consumable findings that downstream agents can act on)**

</critical_requirements>

---

**Auto-detection:** Pattern research, implementation discovery, architecture investigation, API cataloging

**When to use:**

- Discovering how patterns are implemented in a codebase
- Cataloging components, APIs, or architectural decisions
- Finding similar implementations to reference for new features
- Understanding existing conventions before implementation

**Key patterns covered:**

- Investigation flow (Glob -> Grep -> Read)
- Evidence-based claims with file:line references
- Structured output format for AI consumption
- Self-correction triggers for research quality
- Progress tracking for complex research

**When NOT to use:**

- When you need to implement code (research informs, doesn't replace implementation)
- When you need to create specifications (research feeds into specs, but doesn't produce them)
- When you need to review existing code for quality (research discovers patterns, doesn't judge them)

<philosophy>

## Philosophy

Research is investigation, not speculation. Every claim must be backed by evidence from actual code files. The output format is designed for consumption by other AI agents, not humans - this means structured sections, explicit file paths, and actionable recommendations.

**Core Research Principles:**

1. **Evidence First** - Never claim a pattern exists without reading the file
2. **Verify Paths** - Every file path in findings must be confirmed with Read
3. **Be Specific** - Line numbers, not vague references
4. **Be Actionable** - Tell developers exactly which files to reference
5. **Be Honest** - If you can't find something, say so

</philosophy>

<patterns>

## Core Patterns

### Pattern 1: Investigation Flow (Glob -> Grep -> Read)

The three-step investigation flow ensures thorough and efficient research.

#### Flow Structure

```
1. GLOB - Find candidate files
   ├── Use file patterns (*.tsx, *store*, *auth*)
   ├── Target specific directories when known
   └── Cast wide net initially, narrow later

2. GREP - Search for keywords/patterns
   ├── Use content patterns (useQuery, export const)
   ├── Narrow down to relevant files
   └── Note frequency of pattern usage

3. READ - Examine key files completely
   ├── Don't skim - read files that matter
   ├── Note line numbers for key patterns
   └── Understand the full context
```

**Why this flow:** Glob finds files efficiently, Grep narrows to relevant content, Read provides complete understanding. This prevents speculation and ensures evidence-based claims.

For detailed code examples, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md#pattern-1-investigation-flow).

---

### Pattern 2: Evidence-Based Claims

Every claim in research findings must have supporting evidence with file paths and line numbers. Include the file path, line range, usage count, actual code snippet, and verification status.

**Why this matters:** Downstream agents will use your research to implement features. Inaccurate or unverified claims will lead them astray.

For the claim structure template and good/bad comparison examples, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md#pattern-2-evidence-based-claims).

---

### Pattern 3: Structured Output Format

Research findings follow a consistent structure for AI consumption. Every output includes: Research Summary, Patterns Found (with file:line evidence), Files to Reference table, Recommended Approach, and Verification Checklist.

**Why structured:** Other AI agents parse this output. Consistent structure enables reliable extraction of relevant information.

For the complete output template, see [examples/core.md](examples/core.md#pattern-3-structured-output-format).

<self_correction_triggers>

## Self-Correction Checkpoints

**If you notice yourself:**

- **Reporting patterns without reading files first** -> STOP. Use Read to verify the pattern exists.
- **Making claims about architecture without evidence** -> STOP. Find specific file:line references.
- **Attempting to write or edit files** -> STOP. You are read-only. Produce findings instead.
- **Providing generic advice instead of specific paths** -> STOP. Replace with concrete file references.
- **Assuming APIs without reading source** -> STOP. Read the actual source file.
- **Skipping file path verification** -> STOP. Use Read to confirm every path you report.
- **Expanding scope beyond the research question** -> STOP. Answer what was asked, no more.
- **Giving implementation opinions when asked for research** -> STOP. Report findings, not recommendations.

</self_correction_triggers>

<post_action_reflection>

## Post-Action Reflection

**After each research action, evaluate:**

1. Did I verify all file paths exist before including them?
2. Are my pattern claims backed by specific code examples?
3. Have I included line numbers for key references?
4. Is this research actionable for the consuming agent?
5. Did I stay within the scope of the research question?
6. Did I miss any obvious related patterns?

Only report findings when you have verified evidence for all claims.

</post_action_reflection>

<progress_tracking>

## Progress Tracking

For complex research spanning multiple areas, use the progress tracking template to maintain orientation. Track files examined, patterns found, and gaps identified.

See [examples/core.md - Pattern 6](examples/core.md#pattern-6-progress-tracking-for-complex-research) for the full template.

</progress_tracking>

---

<integration>

## Integration Guide

**Research is read-only.** Never write or edit files during research. Produce structured findings that other agents can act on.

**Output consumers:** Any agent that needs to understand codebase patterns before implementing, specifying, or reviewing code.

</integration>

<red_flags>

## RED FLAGS

**High Priority Issues:**

- Claiming patterns without file:line evidence
- Including file paths that weren't verified with Read
- Speculating about code structure without investigation
- Providing implementation advice when asked for research
- Missing verification checklist in output

**Medium Priority Issues:**

- Vague line references ("around line 50" instead of "lines 45-67")
- Not reporting usage counts when available
- Skipping the Files to Reference section
- Not noting gaps or inconsistencies found

**Common Mistakes:**

- Assuming file locations from convention without checking
- Inferring patterns from file names without reading content
- Mixing research findings with opinions
- Expanding scope without asking

**Gotchas & Edge Cases:**

- Some patterns exist but are deprecated (check for `@deprecated` comments)
- Tests may show patterns that differ from production code
- Config files may override patterns in source code
- Monorepo patterns may vary by package

See [reference.md](reference.md) for anti-pattern code examples and the quality checklist.
