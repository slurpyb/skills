# Competitor Research - Comprehensive Intelligence

## Setup

Read your credentials from ~/.gooseworks/credentials.json:
```bash
export GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.gooseworks/credentials.json'))['api_key'])")
export GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE=$(python3 -c "import json;print(json.load(open('$HOME/.gooseworks/credentials.json')).get('api_base','https://api.gooseworks.ai'))")
```

If ~/.gooseworks/credentials.json does not exist, tell the user to run: `npx gooseworks login`

All endpoints use Bearer auth: `-H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY"`


Gather comprehensive intelligence on competitors including products, pricing, team, and strategy.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Company Overview
Get basic company information:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"brand-dev","path":"/v1/brand/retrieve","query":{"domain":"competitor.com"}}'
```

### Step 2: Find Similar Companies
Use Exa to find related competitors:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"exa","path":"/findSimilar"}'
  "url": "https://notion.so",
  "num_results": 10
}'
```

### Step 3: Get Product Details
Scrape pricing and features:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"scrapegraph","path":"/v1/smartscraper"}'
  "website_url": "https://notion.so/pricing",
  "user_prompt": "Extract all pricing tiers, features per tier, and any enterprise options"
}'
```

### Step 4: Research Team
Find key people at the company:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"fiber","path":"/v1/people-search"}'
  "searchParams": {
    "company_names": ["Notion"],
    "job_titles": ["CEO", "CTO", "VP Product", "VP Engineering"]
  }
}'
```

## Example Usage

```bash
# Find competitor customers
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"exa","path":"/search"}'
  "query": "companies using Notion for documentation case studies",
  "num_results": 20
}'
```

List all endpoints, or add a path for parameter details:

```bash
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"brand-dev API endpoints"}' api show exa
curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/search \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"fiber API endpoints"}' api show scrapegraph
```

Example: `curl -s -X POST $GOOSEWORKS_API_BASE/v1/proxy/orthogonal/details \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GOOSEWORKS_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"api":"olostep","path":"/v1/scrapes`"}' for endpoint parameters.
