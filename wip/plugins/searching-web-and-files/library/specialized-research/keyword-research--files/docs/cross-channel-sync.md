## 1. The Cross-Channel Challenge

Modern marketing rarely lives on a single channel. Your audience sees your LinkedIn post at 8 AM, your Instagram Reel at lunch, your email at 3 PM, and your Google Ad when they search that evening. Each of those touchpoints needs to feel like it came from the same brand with the same message, but each channel has its own rules, formats, and expectations.

Here is what makes cross-channel marketing hard:

**Different content formats.** A LinkedIn thought leadership article is not an Instagram Reel is not a Google responsive search ad is not a welcome email. The same campaign concept must be expressed in radically different containers. A 2,000-word article cannot be copy-pasted into a 280-character tweet. An email subject line requires a different writing muscle than a video script.

**Different character limits.** Every platform enforces its own constraints. Twitter gives you 280 characters. LinkedIn allows up to 3,000 for organic posts. Instagram captions can run to 2,200 characters. TikTok descriptions allow up to 4,000. Google Ads headlines max out at 30 characters each. Email subject lines should stay under 40 characters for mobile preview. These are not suggestions — they are hard walls that truncate your message if you exceed them.

**Different voice adaptations.** Your brand voice does not change across channels, but its expression does. LinkedIn expects a more professional register. TikTok rewards casual, direct energy. Email can be personal and conversational. Google Ads demand compressed clarity. The underlying personality is the same — the knobs are turned differently for each context.

**Coordinated timing.** A product launch does not work if your email goes out on Tuesday, your social posts appear Thursday, and your ads start next Monday. Channels need to fire in a deliberate sequence: teasers build anticipation, the launch moment hits across all channels simultaneously, social proof sustains momentum, and urgency drives the close. Getting this wrong means some channels are shouting about a launch that other channels have not mentioned yet.

**Consistent core messaging.** Despite all the format and tone differences, the core value proposition must remain consistent. A customer who sees your LinkedIn post should recognize the same product story when they open your email. If LinkedIn says "40% lighter" and the email says "50% lighter," you have a credibility problem. Every channel version should be a different expression of the same truth.

**Unified tracking.** Without standardized UTM parameters, you cannot tell which channel drove which outcome. If your email team uses `utm_source=email-blast` and your social team uses `utm_source=IG` and your ad team uses `utm_source=google_ads`, your analytics become a mess of inconsistent labels that cannot be compared or aggregated. Cross-channel measurement requires a shared tracking taxonomy enforced from day one.

The plugin is built specifically to solve these problems. Not by doing your job for you, but by providing the architecture that keeps every channel output connected to one source of truth.

---

## 2. How the Plugin Keeps Things Synced

Four components of the plugin work together to maintain cross-channel coherence. Understanding how they connect is the key to using the plugin effectively for multi-channel campaigns.

### Brand Profile = Single Source of Truth

Every piece of channel-specific content starts from the same brand profile, stored at `~/.claude-marketing/brands/{slug}/profile.json`. This profile contains:

- **Voice parameters** (formality, energy, humor, authority on 1-10 scales) that shape tone across every output
- **Brand traits** (e.g., "warm, knowledgeable, passionate") that guide word choice and personality
- **Industry context** that determines which compliance rules and benchmarks apply
- **Active channels** that define where the brand operates
- **Strategic goals** that prioritize what every campaign should optimize for
- **Compliance rules** (FTC, GDPR, CAN-SPAM, industry-specific) that constrain what can be said and how

When a customer sees your LinkedIn post at 9 AM and opens your email at 2 PM, the brand profile ensures both outputs were generated from the same voice settings, the same value proposition, and the same compliance rules. The customer experiences one brand, not two marketing teams with different briefs.

### Campaign Orchestrator = Cross-Channel Coordinator

The Campaign Orchestrator module (`skills/campaign-orchestrator/`) is purpose-built for multi-channel work. When you ask for a campaign plan, it creates a unified strategy document that includes:

- **Channel-specific tactics** all aligned to a single campaign objective. Every channel knows the campaign goal, not just its own KPI.
- **Phased timelines** with sequencing across channels. Teaser content fires before launch content. Social proof content follows early sales. Each phase defines exactly which channels are active and what they are doing.
- **Budget allocation** across channels using one of three models (70/20/10, efficiency-ranked, or funnel-weighted) based on available performance data.
- **Unified KPIs** that roll up from channel-level metrics to campaign-level outcomes. Individual channel metrics (email CTR, social engagement, ad ROAS) feed into the campaign's North Star metric (revenue, pre-orders, sign-ups).

The orchestrator references `channel-strategy.md` for channel selection and synergy mapping, `budget-allocation.md` for spend distribution, and `campaign-planning.md` for brief structure. It checks campaign history via `campaign-tracker.py` so new plans build on past performance data.

### Content Engine = Platform Adapter

The Content Engine module takes one core message and adapts it to each platform's format and expectations. This is where the plugin prevents the most common cross-channel failure: manually rewriting the same idea for every channel and introducing inconsistencies along the way.

For each platform adaptation, the Content Engine:

- **Respects character limits** by referencing `skills/context-engine/platform-specs.md`, which contains specifications for 20+ platforms including character counts, image dimensions, video lengths, and algorithm signals.
- **Adjusts tone within the brand's voice range.** The brand profile's voice parameters define the center of gravity. The Content Engine shifts slightly more casual for TikTok, slightly more formal for LinkedIn, more personal for email — without leaving the brand's voice envelope.
- **Formats correctly for each platform.** Hashtags for social (with platform-appropriate counts), subject lines and preview text for email, headlines within character limits for ads, CTAs formatted for the conversion context.
- **Maintains the core value proposition** across every version. The key claims, the differentiator, the offer — these stay identical. Only the packaging changes.

The `social-post-formatter.py` script validates content against 9 social platforms: Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, TikTok, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest, and YouTube. It checks character limits, hashtag counts, mention formatting, and link placement before content is finalized.

### Platform Specs = Guardrails

The `platform-specs.md` reference file acts as an automatic guardrail system. It contains specifications for every major marketing platform:

- **Character limits** enforced per platform and per field (post body, headline, description, subject line)
- **Image and video dimensions** with recommended sizes for each placement
- **Algorithm signal optimization** including ideal hashtag counts per platform, optimal post lengths for engagement, and engagement hook patterns that each platform's algorithm favors
- **Format requirements** like aspect ratios, file types, and maximum file sizes

When the plugin generates content for a specific channel, it validates against these specs automatically. You do not need to remember that LinkedIn organic posts should stay under 3,000 characters or that Google Ads responsive search ad headlines cap at 30 characters. The specs are applied as constraints during content generation.

## 3. Worked Example: Cross-Channel Product Launch

Here is a complete example of how the plugin plans and coordinates a multi-channel product launch. This shows the full workflow from initial request through phased execution.

```
You: We're launching our new UltraLight Hiking Pack next month. Plan a launch
campaign across email, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Google Ads.

Plugin (Campaign Orchestrator activates):

=== UltraLight Pack Launch -- Cross-Channel Campaign Plan ===

Objective: 500 pre-orders in 30 days, $35 target CPA

Phase 1: Teaser (Week -2 to -1)
+-- Email: "Something light is coming" teaser to VIP subscribers (2,000 list)
+-- Instagram: Behind-the-scenes Stories of product testing in the Rockies
+-- LinkedIn: CEO post about the engineering challenge of ultralight design
+-- Google Ads: Not yet (save budget for launch)

Phase 2: Launch (Week 0)
+-- Email: Full launch announcement with early-bird 15% off (segmented by buyer history)
+-- Instagram: Carousel post (5 images: pack features) + Reel (30s weight comparison)
+-- LinkedIn: Product announcement with technical specs + sustainability story
+-- Google Ads: Shopping ads + branded search + "ultralight hiking pack" keywords

Phase 3: Social Proof (Week 1-2)
+-- Email: Customer review roundup + "hikers are saying..."
+-- Instagram: UGC reposts from early buyers + influencer Reels
+-- LinkedIn: Case study: "How we reduced pack weight by 40%"
+-- Google Ads: Retarget site visitors, add review extensions

Phase 4: Urgency (Week 3-4)
+-- Email: "Only X packs left at launch price" + countdown
+-- Instagram: Countdown Stories + final push Reel
+-- LinkedIn: "Last week for early pricing" update
+-- Google Ads: Increase bids on converting keywords, reduce on low performers

UTM Taxonomy (unified across all channels):
- utm_source: email / instagram / linkedin / google
- utm_medium: email / social / social / cpc
- utm_campaign: ultralight-pack-launch-2026
- utm_content: teaser / launch / socialproof / urgency

Budget Allocation:
- Email: $800 (platform costs only -- highest ROI channel)
- Instagram: $3,500 (paid promotion + influencer)
- LinkedIn: $2,000 (sponsored posts)
- Google Ads: $6,000 (Shopping + Search)
- Total: $12,300 / Target: 500 pre-orders = $24.60 target CPA (under $35)
```

### What Makes This Plan Work

The plugin did several things that a single-channel plan would miss:

**Sequenced activation.** Google Ads does not start spending until launch day. There is no point paying for clicks when there is nothing to buy yet. Meanwhile, email and social build anticipation during the teaser phase at minimal cost.

**Channel-appropriate roles.** Each channel has a job that matches its strengths. Email handles direct conversion (highest ROI, most personal). Instagram drives visual storytelling and social proof. LinkedIn tells the brand and engineering story to a professional audience. Google Ads captures active purchase intent.

**Phased messaging arc.** The campaign follows a narrative: curiosity (teaser) to information (launch) to validation (social proof) to action (urgency). Every channel follows the same arc but expresses it differently.

**Unified UTM structure.** The `utm_content` parameter tracks which phase drove each conversion. After the campaign, you can see whether teaser emails drove more pre-orders than urgency emails, whether social proof Instagram posts outperformed launch posts, and exactly which channel-phase combination delivered the best CPA.

**Budget weighted by channel efficiency.** Email gets the smallest budget because it costs almost nothing beyond platform fees. Google Ads gets the largest because it captures high-intent searchers. The total budget is designed to hit the 500 pre-order target at $24.60 CPA, well under the $35 ceiling.

---

## 4. Content Adaptation in Action

This section shows how one core message transforms into platform-specific content while keeping the value proposition intact.

**Core message:** "The UltraLight Pack weighs just 18oz -- 40% lighter than the competition. Made from recycled ocean plastic. Pre-order now at 15% off."

Three facts. One offer. Here is how each channel expresses them.

### LinkedIn (professional tone, ~350 characters used of 3,000 max)

```
We spent 18 months solving a problem every serious hiker knows: your pack
is too heavy.

The result? The UltraLight Pack at just 18oz -- 40% lighter than anything
else on the market.

Built from recycled ocean plastic because performance and sustainability
shouldn't be tradeoffs.

Pre-order now with 15% off for the first 500 hikers.
#OutdoorGear #Sustainability #HikingGear
```

**Adaptation notes:** Opens with the engineering narrative (LinkedIn audiences value the "how we built it" story). Uses a professional but not corporate tone. Three hashtags (LinkedIn's sweet spot). Positions the product as a solution to a known problem.

### Instagram (visual-first, casual, ~280 characters used of 2,200 max)

```
18 ounces. That's it.

Our new UltraLight Pack is 40% lighter than the nearest competitor -- and
it's made from recycled ocean plastic.

Link in bio for 15% off pre-orders.

Who's ready to lighten their load? Drop a comment below.

#ultralighthiking #hikingpack #sustainableoutdoors #hikingadventures
#outdoorgear
```

**Adaptation notes:** Opens with the most arresting number (weight). Shorter, punchier sentences. Engagement hook at the end ("drop a comment below") because Instagram's algorithm rewards comment activity. Five hashtags in the discoverability range. "Link in bio" because Instagram does not allow clickable links in captions.

### Email Subject Line (under 40 characters for mobile)

```
40% lighter. 100% recycled. Pre-order now
```

**Adaptation notes:** 42 characters (close to the 40-character mobile-preview target). Front-loads the two strongest differentiators. Ends with clear CTA. No hashtags, no emojis, no brand name (the "From" field already shows who sent it).

### Google Ads RSA Headlines (30 characters each, max)

```
Headline 1: UltraLight Pack -- Just 18oz
Headline 2: 40% Lighter Than Competition
Headline 3: Recycled Ocean Plastic Gear
Headline 4: Pre-Order: 15% Off Today
```

**Adaptation notes:** Each headline stands alone (Google's responsive search ads combine them in different orders). Every headline is under 30 characters. Each one communicates a different selling point so the ad works regardless of which combination Google serves.

### What Stayed Consistent

Across all four versions, notice what did not change:

- The weight claim: 18oz, every time
- The comparison: 40% lighter, every time
- The sustainability angle: recycled ocean plastic, every time
- The offer: 15% off pre-orders, every time

The packaging changed. The substance did not. That is what cross-channel consistency looks like in practice.

---

## 5. UTM Tracking Standardization

Unified tracking is what makes cross-channel marketing measurable instead of anecdotal. Without it, you are guessing which channels drove results. The plugin enforces a standardized UTM system through the Campaign Orchestrator and `utm-generator.py`.

### How the UTM Taxonomy Works

When the Campaign Orchestrator builds a campaign plan, it simultaneously generates a UTM taxonomy that follows strict naming conventions:

| Parameter | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `utm_source` | Lowercase platform name | `email`, `instagram`, `linkedin`, `google` |
| `utm_medium` | Channel type | `email`, `social`, `cpc`, `display` |
| `utm_campaign` | Hyphenated campaign name with year | `ultralight-pack-launch-2026` |
| `utm_term` | Keyword or audience segment (optional) | `ultralight-hiking-pack`, `vip-subscribers` |
| `utm_content` | Creative variant or campaign phase | `teaser`, `launch`, `socialproof-carousel` |

All values are lowercase, hyphen-separated, with no special characters. This consistency means your analytics tool can aggregate and compare without manual cleanup.

### Campaign-Level URL Examples

For the UltraLight Pack launch, the generated URLs would look like:

```
Email teaser:
site.com/ultralight?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=ultralight-pack-launch-2026&utm_content=teaser

Instagram launch carousel:
site.com/ultralight?utm_source=instagram&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ultralight-pack-launch-2026&utm_content=launch-carousel

LinkedIn social proof:
site.com/ultralight?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ultralight-pack-launch-2026&utm_content=socialproof-casestudy

Google Ads branded search:
site.com/ultralight?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=ultralight-pack-launch-2026&utm_term=ultralight-hiking-pack&utm_content=rsa-v1
```

### QR Codes for Offline-to-Online Tracking

The `utm-generator.py` script can generate QR codes for UTM-tagged URLs. This bridges offline marketing (trade show banners, product packaging, print ads, direct mail) to your digital analytics:

```
utm-generator.py --url "site.com/ultralight" --source "qr" --medium "print"
    --campaign "ultralight-pack-launch-2026" --content "tradeshow-banner" --qr
```

The generated QR code links to the full UTM-tagged URL, so when someone scans it, the visit is attributed correctly in your analytics. This is particularly valuable for product launches with a physical component (events, retail displays, packaging inserts).

### Why This Matters for Cross-Channel Analysis

With standardized UTMs, all channel performance rolls up to a single campaign view:

```
Campaign: ultralight-pack-launch-2026

Source/Medium          Sessions   Conversions   Revenue     CPA
email / email             1,240         142    $21,300    $5.63
instagram / social        3,800          95    $14,250   $36.84
linkedin / social           890          28     $4,200   $71.43
google / cpc              2,100          67    $10,050   $89.55
qr / print                  180          12     $1,800      --
-------------------------------------------------------------
Total                     8,210         344    $51,600   $35.76
```

Without the standardized taxonomy, this table does not exist. With it, you can see immediately that email is the most efficient channel, Instagram drives volume at a reasonable CPA, and Google Ads needs keyword optimization to bring CPA down.

---

## 6. Mid-Campaign Strategy Adjustments

Campaigns rarely run perfectly from day one. The plugin supports mid-campaign analysis and reallocation through the `/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report` command, which compares current results against the targets set in the campaign plan.

### Reading a Mid-Campaign Report

```
(Week 2 of the UltraLight launch)

You: /digital-marketing-pro:performance-report for the UltraLight launch

Plugin:

=== UltraLight Pack Launch -- Week 2 Performance ===

Overall: 311 of 500 pre-orders (62% of target with 50% of campaign remaining)

Channel Breakdown:
- Email: 4.2% CTR, 89 pre-orders (on track)
- Instagram: 2.8% engagement rate, 120 pre-orders (exceeding target)
- LinkedIn: 0.8% CTR, 35 pre-orders (underperforming)
- Google Ads: $42 CPA, 67 pre-orders (over $35 CPA target)

Phase Performance:
- Teaser phase: 48 pre-orders (above expectations -- VIP list responded well)
- Launch phase: 185 pre-orders (strong)
- Social proof phase (current): 78 pre-orders (on track)

Recommendations:
1. Shift $500 from LinkedIn to Instagram (higher conversion rate, lower CPA)
2. Pause broad match keywords on Google Ads (driving up CPA with low-intent clicks)
3. Add Instagram Shopping tags to all product posts (capitalize on high engagement)
4. LinkedIn: test CEO personal post vs. company page post (personal posts get 5x reach)
5. Double down on email -- send a "most popular features" email to non-openers from launch
```

### How to Act on Recommendations

The plugin's recommendations are not just observations. They are tied to specific actions you can execute immediately:

**Budget reallocation.** The recommendation to shift $500 from LinkedIn to Instagram is based on the data showing Instagram's CPA ($29.17) is significantly lower than LinkedIn's ($57.14). The Campaign Orchestrator's budget-allocation framework includes pre-defined reallocation triggers: when one channel's CPA exceeds 150% of another's, budget should flow toward the more efficient channel.

**Keyword optimization.** The Google Ads recommendation to pause broad match keywords comes from diagnosing why CPA is over target. Broad match drives impressions but attracts low-intent searches. Pausing them and concentrating budget on exact and phrase match (where intent is higher) should reduce CPA toward the $35 target.

**Channel tactic changes.** The LinkedIn recommendation is not to abandon the channel but to change the tactic. Company page posts have limited organic reach. CEO personal posts consistently reach 5-10x more people on LinkedIn. This is a format change, not a channel change.

**Doubling down on what works.** Email at 4.2% CTR and Instagram at 2.8% engagement are both strong. The recommendation to send a follow-up email to non-openers extends the reach of the highest-ROI channel at near-zero incremental cost.

### When to Make Adjustments vs. Wait

Not every underperforming metric requires immediate action. The plugin considers these factors before recommending changes:

- **Statistical significance.** Small sample sizes can produce misleading results. The plugin flags when a recommendation is based on limited data.
- **Time lag.** Some channels (especially Google Ads) need 7-14 days for algorithms to optimize. Cutting spend too early prevents the algorithm from learning.
- **Phase context.** A channel that underperforms in the teaser phase might excel in the urgency phase. The recommendation accounts for where each channel fits in the campaign arc.
- **Cannibalization risk.** Shifting too much budget to one channel can saturate the audience and increase costs. The plugin recommends incremental shifts, not wholesale reallocation.

## 7. Quarterly Strategy Reviews

Individual campaign performance tells you what happened this month. Quarterly reviews tell you what to do next quarter. The plugin supports these reviews by aggregating performance data across all campaigns in a period and comparing channels on a level playing field.

### Running a Quarterly Review

```
You: Review our channel performance across all Q2 campaigns

Plugin: Analyzing 4 campaigns across Q2 2026...

Campaigns included:
1. UltraLight Pack Launch (April)
2. Summer Trailhead Series -- Content Campaign (May)
3. Father's Day Gift Guide (June)
4. Sustainability Story -- Brand Awareness (June)

Channel Effectiveness (Q2 aggregate):
| Channel     | Spend   | Revenue  | ROAS  | CPA  | Best For              |
|-------------|---------|----------|-------|------|-----------------------|
| Email       | $2,400  | $34,000  | 14.2x | $8   | Retention, launches   |
| Instagram   | $12,000 | $28,000  | 2.3x  | $24  | Awareness, social proof|
| Google Ads  | $18,000 | $31,000  | 1.7x  | $38  | New customer acquisition|
| LinkedIn    | $6,000  | $8,500   | 1.4x  | $52  | B2B partnerships      |

Channel Trends (Q1 --> Q2):
- Email ROAS improved from 11.8x to 14.2x (post-purchase sequence driving repeats)
- Instagram CPA decreased from $31 to $24 (UGC creative outperforming studio creative)
- Google Ads CPA increased from $34 to $38 (keyword competition heating up)
- LinkedIn CPA stable at $52 (consistent but expensive -- evaluate role)

Content Format Performance:
| Format               | Avg. Engagement | Avg. Conversion Rate |
|----------------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Email sequences      | 4.1% CTR       | 3.2%                 |
| Instagram Reels      | 3.4% engagement | 1.8%                 |
| Instagram Carousels  | 2.1% engagement | 2.4%                 |
| LinkedIn articles    | 1.2% engagement | 0.9%                 |
| Google Shopping ads  | 2.8% CTR       | 4.1%                 |
| Google RSA           | 3.2% CTR       | 2.6%                 |

Q3 Recommendations:
1. Increase email budget by 20% -- highest ROAS channel with room to grow
   (list is growing, open rates stable)
2. Shift 30% of LinkedIn budget to Instagram -- Instagram delivers 2.7x better
   ROAS and has not saturated yet
3. Google Ads: audit keyword portfolio to reduce CPA -- pause keywords with
   CPA above $50, test new long-tail terms from SEO keyword data
4. Test TikTok as a new channel -- audience demographics overlap with Instagram,
   lower CPMs, and competitor activity is increasing there
5. Double down on Instagram Reels and UGC -- highest engagement format,
   lower production cost than studio creative
```

### Using Quarterly Insights to Refine Channel Strategy

The quarterly review is not just a report. It feeds back into the plugin's planning system for the next quarter:

**Budget reallocation across quarters.** Q2 data showed email delivers 14.2x ROAS while LinkedIn delivers 1.4x. The Q3 recommendation shifts budget from the lowest-performing channel to proven performers. This is the efficiency-ranked budget allocation model in action, where channels earn their budget through demonstrated results.

**New channel testing.** The recommendation to test TikTok is not based on hype. It is based on three signals: audience demographic overlap with your best-performing channel (Instagram), lower CPMs (cost efficiency), and competitor activity (competitive intelligence). The plugin's channel evaluation checklist from `channel-strategy.md` provides the framework for a structured 30-day test.

**Format optimization.** Knowing that Instagram Reels outperform Carousels on engagement (3.4% vs. 2.1%) while Carousels outperform on conversion (2.4% vs. 1.8%) lets you assign the right format to the right campaign phase. Reels for awareness phases, Carousels for conversion phases.

**Insight accumulation.** These findings are saved via the SessionEnd hook to `insights.json`, so the next time you plan a campaign, the plugin already knows that UGC content outperforms studio creative on Instagram, that email is your most efficient channel, and that LinkedIn works for B2B partnership campaigns but is not cost-effective for direct consumer acquisition.

### The Compounding Effect of Quarterly Reviews

Each quarter's review builds on the last:

- **Q1**: Baseline established. Channels selected based on industry benchmarks and brand profile.
- **Q2**: First performance data available. Initial reallocation based on actual results. Early insights saved.
- **Q3**: Two quarters of data enable trend analysis. Confidence in channel roles increases. New channel tests informed by what has worked.
- **Q4+**: The plugin has enough historical data to project seasonal patterns, predict channel saturation points, and recommend preemptive budget shifts before performance degrades.

By the fourth quarter, your cross-channel strategy is no longer based on industry averages or best guesses. It is calibrated to your brand's specific audience, your specific creative strengths, and your specific channel economics. The plugin's campaign history and insight system ensures that every planning cycle starts from accumulated knowledge rather than a blank page.

## Bringing It All Together

Cross-channel marketing breaks when channels operate in silos. Different teams create different messages with different tracking and different timing, and the customer experiences a fragmented brand.

The plugin prevents this by enforcing a shared architecture:

| Component | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Brand Profile | Single source of truth for voice, goals, compliance | Every channel starts from the same brief |
| Campaign Orchestrator | Coordinates timing, budget, and KPIs across channels | Channels work together, not in parallel |
| Content Engine + Platform Specs | Adapts one message to each platform's format | Consistency without copy-paste |
| UTM Taxonomy | Standardized tracking across all channels | Every conversion is attributed correctly |
| `/digital-marketing-pro:content-calendar` | Synchronized editorial calendar | Timing is coordinated, not accidental |
| `/digital-marketing-pro:campaign-plan` | Phased multi-channel campaign plans | Each channel knows its role in each phase |
| `/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report` | Cross-channel performance comparison | Reallocation decisions based on data |
| SessionEnd Auto-Save | Insights preserved for future planning | Next campaign is smarter than the last |

The goal is not to make every channel say the same thing in the same way. It is to make every channel say the right thing in the right way for that platform, while staying connected to the same strategy, the same brand, and the same measurement system.

Start with `/digital-marketing-pro:campaign-plan` to build your next cross-channel campaign. Use `/digital-marketing-pro:content-calendar` to coordinate the timing. Let the Content Engine adapt your message to each platform. Track everything with standardized UTMs. Review with `/digital-marketing-pro:performance-report`. Learn, adjust, and repeat.
