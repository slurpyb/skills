FastAPI has a very powerful but intuitive Dependency Injection system.

It is designed to be very simple to use, and to make it very easy for any developer to integrate other components with FastAPI.

"Dependency Injection" means, in programming, that there is a way for your code (in this case, your path operation functions) to declare things that it requires to work and use: "dependencies".

And then, that system (in this case FastAPI) will take care of doing whatever is needed to provide your code with those needed dependencies ("inject" the dependencies).

This is very useful when you need to:

All these, while minimizing code repetition.

Let's see a very simple example. It will be so simple that it is not very useful, for now.

But this way we can focus on how the Dependency Injection system works.

Let's first focus on the dependency.

It is just a function that can take all the same parameters that a path operation function can take:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

And it has the same shape and structure that all your path operation functions have.

You can think of it as a path operation function without the "decorator" (without the @app.get("/some-path")).

And it can return anything you want.

In this case, this dependency expects:

And then it just returns a dict containing those values.

FastAPI added support for Annotated (and started recommending it) in version 0.95.0.

If you have an older version, you would get errors when trying to use Annotated.

Make sure you Upgrade the FastAPI version to at least 0.95.1 before using Annotated.

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

The same way you use Body, Query, etc. with your path operation function parameters, use Depends with a new parameter:

Prefer to use the Annotated version if possible.

Although you use Depends in the parameters of your function the same way you use Body, Query, etc, Depends works a bit differently.

You only give Depends a single parameter.

This parameter must be something like a function.

You don't call it directly (don't add the parenthesis at the end), you just pass it as a parameter to Depends().

And that function takes parameters in the same way that path operation functions do.

You'll see what other "things", apart from functions, can be used as dependencies in the next chapter.

Whenever a new request arrives, FastAPI will take care of:

This way you write shared code once and FastAPI takes care of calling it for your path operations.

Notice that you don't have to create a special class and pass it somewhere to FastAPI to "register" it or anything similar.

You just pass it to Depends and FastAPI knows how to do the rest.

In the examples above, you see that there's a tiny bit of code duplication.

When you need to use the common_parameters() dependency, you have to write the whole parameter with the type annotation and Depends():

But because we are using Annotated, we can store that Annotated value in a variable and use it in multiple places:

This is just standard Python, it's called a "type alias", it's actually not specific to FastAPI.

But because FastAPI is based on the Python standards, including Annotated, you can use this trick in your code. 😎

The dependencies will keep working as expected, and the best part is that the type information will be preserved, which means that your editor will be able to keep providing you with autocompletion, inline errors, etc. The same for other tools like mypy.

This will be especially useful when you use it in a large code base where you use the same dependencies over and over again in many path operations.

As dependencies will also be called by FastAPI (the same as your path operation functions), the same rules apply while defining your functions.

You can use async def or normal def.

And you can declare dependencies with async def inside of normal def path operation functions, or def dependencies inside of async def path operation functions, etc.

It doesn't matter. FastAPI will know what to do.

If you don't know, check the Async: "In a hurry?" section about async and await in the docs.

All the request declarations, validations and requirements of your dependencies (and sub-dependencies) will be integrated in the same OpenAPI schema.

So, the interactive docs will have all the information from these dependencies too:

If you look at it, path operation functions are declared to be used whenever a path and operation matches, and then FastAPI takes care of calling the function with the correct parameters, extracting the data from the request.

Actually, all (or most) of the web frameworks work in this same way.

You never call those functions directly. They are called by your framework (in this case, FastAPI).

With the Dependency Injection system, you can also tell FastAPI that your path operation function also "depends" on something else that should be executed before your path operation function, and FastAPI will take care of executing it and "injecting" the results.

Other common terms for this same idea of "dependency injection" are:

Integrations and "plug-ins" can be built using the Dependency Injection system. But in fact, there is actually no need to create "plug-ins", as by using dependencies it's possible to declare an infinite number of integrations and interactions that become available to your path operation functions.

And dependencies can be created in a very simple and intuitive way that allows you to just import the Python packages you need, and integrate them with your API functions in a couple of lines of code, literally.

You will see examples of this in the next chapters, about relational and NoSQL databases, security, etc.

The simplicity of the dependency injection system makes FastAPI compatible with:

Although the hierarchical dependency injection system is very simple to define and use, it's still very powerful.

You can define dependencies that in turn can define dependencies themselves.

In the end, a hierarchical tree of dependencies is built, and the Dependency Injection system takes care of solving all these dependencies for you (and their sub-dependencies) and providing (injecting) the results at each step.

For example, let's say you have 4 API endpoints (path operations):

then you could add different permission requirements for each of them just with dependencies and sub-dependencies:

All these dependencies, while declaring their requirements, also add parameters, validations, etc. to your path operations.

FastAPI will take care of adding it all to the OpenAPI schema, so that it is shown in the interactive documentation systems.

**Examples:**

Example 1 (python):
```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]):
    return commons


@app.get("/users/")
async def read_users(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]):
    return commons
```

Example 2 (python):
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons


@app.get("/users/")
async def read_users(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons
```

Example 3 (python):
```python
from typing import Annotated

from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]):
    return commons


@app.get("/users/")
async def read_users(commons: Annotated[dict, Depends(common_parameters)]):
    return commons
```

Example 4 (python):
```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI

app = FastAPI()


async def common_parameters(q: str | None = None, skip: int = 0, limit: int = 100):
    return {"q": q, "skip": skip, "limit": limit}


@app.get("/items/")
async def read_items(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons


@app.get("/users/")
async def read_users(commons: dict = Depends(common_parameters)):
    return commons
```
