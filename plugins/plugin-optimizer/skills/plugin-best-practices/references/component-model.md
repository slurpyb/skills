# Component Model

Detailed overview of Claude Code plugin component types. Per the upstream plugins-reference, plugins can ship: **skills**, **agents**, **hooks**, **MCP servers**, **LSP servers**, **monitors**, **themes**, and **output styles**.

## Skills

Skills are markdown prompts that run in the main conversation context and extend knowledge or provide workflows.

Two skill types are supported:
- **Instruction-type** (`user-invocable: true` → `commands`): imperative voice, phase-based workflows (with optional "Initialization" and "Background Knowledge" pre-phase sections), user-invoked.
- **Knowledge-type** (`user-invocable: false` → `skills`): declarative voice, topic-based references, auto-loaded.

### Progressive Disclosure

Skills use a three-tier token budget structure:

| Tier | Location | Token Target | Loading | Purpose |
|------|----------|--------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Frontmatter description | ~50 tokens | Discovery phase | Trigger phrases for routing |
| 2 | SKILL.md body | ~500 tokens | Skill invocation | Core instructions and workflow |
| 3 | references/ files | 2000+ tokens | On-demand | Detailed specs, examples, reference material |

**Important**: Token targets are recommendations, not hard limits. Validation scripts warn when SKILL.md exceeds ~500 tokens but do NOT fail validation. Include critical information in SKILL.md even if it causes moderate overages (600-700 tokens acceptable if necessary).

## Agents

Agents are autonomous subprocesses with isolated context.

- Isolated context with a dedicated system prompt in the agent `.md` file
- Restricted tool allowlists for safety and focus
- Specialized expertise with judgment over execution details
- Router-friendly descriptions containing 2–4 `<example>` blocks

### Usage Patterns

Agents can be used in two ways:

1.  **Single Agents**: Default mode. The skill launches a single agent for a specialized task.
2.  **Agent Teams**: The skill asks Claude to form a team of agents (see `agent-teams.md`).
    - Use when tasks are **parallelizable** (e.g., refactoring 50 files).
    - Use when tasks need **multi-perspective analysis** (e.g., UX + Security).

## Monitors

Monitors are background shell commands the plugin starts automatically. Every stdout line becomes a Claude notification.

- Use for log tails, status polling, deployment watchers — events Claude should react to without being told to start the watch
- See `./components/monitors.md` for required fields and `when` triggers
- Requires Claude Code v2.1.105+

## Themes

JSON color themes that surface in `/theme` once the plugin is enabled. See `./components/themes.md`.

## Output styles

Markdown files that adjust Claude's response shape (terseness, structure, verbosity). See `./components/output-styles.md`.

## Selection Guide

- **Instruction-type skills** apply when a user invokes a workflow via slash command and the process is linear
- **Knowledge-type skills** apply when providing reference knowledge for agents or the main session
- **Agents** apply when isolation, specialization, and autonomous decision-making are required
- **Monitors** apply when Claude should react to a stream of out-of-band events (logs, deploys, file changes)
- **Themes** ship branded color presets
- **Output styles** modulate response formatting independent of domain logic
