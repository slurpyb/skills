# Workflow: Combination (Local + External)

Use when no single surface can answer: a local clue points upstream, or remote code needs AST, LSP, negative, or many-file proof. Read `references/algorithm.md` first. This bridges `references/workflow-local.md` and `references/workflow-external.md`.

## Local -> External (enrich)

- local dependency / error string / config key -> `npmSearch` or `ghSearchRepos` -> repo -> docs, tests, history.
- "why is this code like this" -> `ghSearchCommits` on the path -> the PR behind the commit via `ghSearchPullRequests` (`reviewMode:"full"` for the whole story).
- "has someone already solved this" -> `ghSearchRepos` triage -> external loop on the best candidates (`references/github-landscape.md` for ranking several).

## External -> Local (materialize, then prove)

One bridge call turns remote code into local-grade evidence; the full local loop then runs unmodified on the returned `localPath`.

| Depth | Call                                | Lands on disk                                            | Use when                               |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| tree  | `ghGetFileContent type:"directory"` | one subtree (bounded — check `skipped` counts)           | analyzing one directory                |
| file  | `ghCloneRepo` + `sparsePath`        | that file's subtree + repo-root files (`complete:false`) | repeated reads/LSP on one file         |
| repo  | `ghCloneRepo` (no sparsePath)       | full shallow clone (`complete:true`)                     | repo-wide grep / AST / LSP / dead-code |

CLI clone works by default; the MCP-server surface requires `ENABLE_CLONE=true` and returns a typed error when disabled. Mark that surface skipped, fall back to file reads, and follow returned `next.localSearch` / `next.viewStructure`.

**Materialize when:** AST / structural, LSP, multi-file regex, exact absence, or the 3rd+ read into one remote area is coming.

## The loop

Loop local clue → external evidence → local proof until the claim reaches the strongest available grade. Check external facts against local reality and local upstream guesses against the source that shipped them.

Next: run the local half with `references/workflow-local.md` and the remote half with `references/workflow-external.md`; once materialized, prove the claim through `references/code-research.md`; when a clone or run needs approval read the gates in `references/octocode.md`.
