# Workflow: Local Research

Use when the running repo, local checkout, or installed dependency is source of truth.
Read `references/algorithm.md` first; read `references/octocode.md` only when tool or CLI syntax is unclear.

```text
localViewStructure / localFindFiles
-> localSearchCode for terms, identifiers, or changed anchors
-> localGetFileContent(symbols or matchString)
-> lspGetSemantics for definition, references, callers, callees, hover
-> localSearchCode structural for code shape; localFindDeadCode for repo-wide dead-export candidates
```

Local-first defaults:

- For package behavior, inspect `node_modules/<pkg>` before GitHub; it is the version that runs.
- For impact claims, diff broad text hits against LSP results before saying "unused", "only", or "safe".
- For edits, find a local pattern first, patch the smallest scope, then run the targeted verification.

Use external surfaces only when they answer something local cannot: upstream intent, fixes in newer versions, PR/commit history, source repo tests, or ecosystem alternatives — see `references/workflow-external.md`.

Next: when remote code must be proven with local-grade tools bridge through `references/workflow-combination.md`; for the proof ladder on a local claim load `references/code-research.md`; when the local finding turns into an edit go to `references/workflow-change.md`.
