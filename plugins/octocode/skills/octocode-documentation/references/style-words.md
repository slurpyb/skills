# Word choice

Load when a specific word is in question — the guide's word list decides, not preference. `assets/google-word-list.tsv` carries all 597 entries as `term`, `verdict` (`dont-use`, `avoid`, `caution`, `usage`), and the guide's own guidance. Look the term up, then quote it:

```bash
grep -iP "^[^\t]*allows you to" assets/google-word-list.tsv
node scripts/style-lint.mjs docs/ --only word-list        # dont-use and avoid terms in prose
node scripts/refresh-word-list.mjs --dry-run              # when an entry looks stale
```

IF a word isn't in the list → THEN follow Merriam-Webster's first listed spelling (`canceled`, not `cancelled`); for a technical term, follow the authoritative documentation for that technology.

`ingest` is conditional: use import, load, or copy for plain data movement, and `ingest` only when the step does significant processing. Keep these spellings: `on-premises`, `OAuth 2.0`, plugin (noun), plug-in (adjective), plug in (verb), allowlist and denylist as nouns.
