# Inclusive terminology

Load when a term might exclude, stereotype, or read as violent — and before touching a replacement table row.

## The root rule

Most of this is one principle: drop idiomatic, figurative, and metaphorical language; use literal, precise terms in their primary sense. Figurative phrasing is what turns ableist, violent, or graphic. Don't build documentation on a metaphor — no "pets versus cattle".

## Replace, but rewrite verbs

- Check that a replacement is technically accurate for your context — and that a list is even involved.
- Don't swap a non-inclusive **verb** for an inclusive one; rewrite the sentence. "You can allow requests from a range of IP addresses", not "You can allowlist a range".
- IF replacing an established term risks confusing readers → THEN name it once in parentheses and use the replacement after: "add them to an allowlist (sometimes called a `whitelist`)".
- IF code, a flag, or an API fixes the term → THEN keep it in code font, use it as little as possible, and use the preferred term in prose.
- IF a graphic term must appear → THEN mention it once and phrase the rest to de-emphasize it.

## Disability, age, and people

- "person with disabilities", or the community's identity-first term (Deaf, autistic, blind). Never "the disabled" or "a quadriplegic" — say "people with disabilities", "a quadriplegic person".
- Don't call people without disabilities `normal` or `healthy`; use nondisabled, sighted, hearing, or neurotypical person.
- No euphemisms: not `physically challenged`, `special`, `differently abled`, or `handi-capable`. No "suffers from", "victim of", "wheelchair-bound".
- "older adults", not "seniors" or cute phrasing; "aging population" works for the group.
- Avoid framing people as "native speakers" versus "non-native speakers".
