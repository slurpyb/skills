# Google style index

Load for any wording, formatting, or terminology question. This maps every topic in the [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style) to the reference that owns its rules, so the guide works as a lookup instead of a read-through. New to the guide: skim `references/style-voice.md` and `references/style-format.md` once, then look things up — most questions are word-list questions (`references/style-words.md`).

## Defaults to apply without looking anything up

These are the lines you don't have to look up — not the rule set. Before you cite a rule, override someone's wording, or answer "what does the guide say", open the owning reference in the preceding table.

- Sentence case headings; second person; active voice; present tense; imperative steps with the condition before the instruction.
- Serial comma; descriptive link text; code font for code, bold for UI labels; alt text on every image.
- No `currently/soon`, no superlatives, no pre-announcements.

## Precedence

1. The project's own documented style guide, when it exists.
2. A convention this repository already applies consistently — report the conflict, don't add a second scheme.
3. This guide.

Deviations are fine when they are deliberate and consistent; say which rule you overrode and why.

Every `style-*.md` ends with links to the guide pages it restates. The live pages outrank this pack: fetch one whenever someone disputes a rule, the pack lacks it, or the wording carries risk, and follow `references/style-sources.md`.

Upstream: [Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) · [Philosophy of this guide](https://developers.google.com/style/philosophy) · [What's new](https://developers.google.com/style/whats-new). Verify a disputed or missing rule against the live page → `references/style-sources.md`.

Next: run `scripts/style-lint.mjs <paths>` for the mechanical hits before hand-reading; interpret each finding with the reference named in its message.
