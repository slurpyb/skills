Not for code, commits, or marketing copy. Code investigation → octocode-research; SKILL.md folders → octocode-skills."

# Octocode Documentation

Evidence-backed docs for humans and agents, written to the Google developer documentation style guide. Classify first. Gate writes. Prefer durable cross-refs over code dumps.

## Flow

`UNDERSTAND → RESEARCH → CLASSIFY → OUTLINE GATE → WRITE → STYLE → VERIFY`

UNDERSTAND names the deliverable, audience, and target paths. Compress when the request already names targets and type. Expand when claims need verification. A copyedit request starts at STYLE. Answer a single-term question ("is `allows you to` okay?") straight from `assets/google-word-list.tsv` — quote the guidance and stop.

## Rules

- Verify claims in the repository before asserting them. Invented commands, paths, APIs, and env vars are the one unrecoverable failure — omit or mark "Not verified in repository" instead.
- Pick one mode and load its routes before writing.
- Gate creates and overwrites unless the requester approved the targets this turn; a copyedit of a named file carries its own approval. Touch only the files they named — propose the rest.
- Apply the style defaults in `references/style-index.md` to every line you write or edit, and name the rule when you change someone else's wording.
- The style references are a snapshot of Google's guide, and every one links the pages it restates. IF someone disputes a rule, the pack doesn't carry it, or the wording carries risk (trademark, product name, legal claim, security claim) → THEN open the live page with a web tool, quote it with its URL, and fix the reference when it disagrees; say so when no fetch was possible.
- A style pass changes wording, not claims; a fact change goes back to RESEARCH.
- `AGENTS.md` is an index of links and non-obvious rules, not a content dump.
- Prefer durable pointers (module path, contract name, doc link) over line numbers and pasted code.
- One Diátaxis type per page; link siblings instead of mixing.
- IF the project documents its own style guide, or the repository already applies a convention consistently → THEN follow it and report the conflict instead of adding a second scheme.

Stop when: outline gate awaits answer; write+style+verify finishes; a word-list lookup answered the question; a missing fact makes the doc dishonest to write (otherwise mark "Not verified in repository" and continue); conventions conflict; user cancels.

## Workflows — the mode fixes the route order

| Mode          | Deliverable                                                 | Route order                                                                                                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| agent-docs    | `AGENTS.md`, nested agent instructions, `CLAUDE.md` symlink | `modes.md` → `evidence-research.md` → `agents-md.md` → `agent-readable.md` → `write-verify.md` → `style-lint.mjs`   |
| human-docs    | README, tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation, runbook   | `modes.md` → `evidence-research.md` → `diataxis.md` → `agent-readable.md` → `write-verify.md` → `style-lint.mjs`    |
| adr           | Architecture decision record                                | `modes.md` → `evidence-research.md` → `adr.md` → `write-verify.md` → `style-lint.mjs`                               |
| codebase-pack | Multi-file docs set                                         | `modes.md` → plan the file set → gate once → per file: `diataxis.md` → `write-verify.md` → `style-lint.mjs`         |
| style-pass    | Edited text, or a style review report                       | `style-index.md` → the owning `style-*.md` → `style-lint.mjs` → `style-review.md` for a report someone else acts on |

Suppression: `<!-- style-lint: ignore-file -->` skips a file found by recursion, `<!-- style-lint: ignore-line rule-id -->` mutes named rules on one line. Both are inert inside a code span, so a page can document them. Docstrings, HTML, and UI strings stay hand-checked.

- Pure code or repository evidence with no docs deliverable → `octocode-research`; authoring a `SKILL.md` → `octocode-skills`.
- Full multi-file pack → plan the file set, gate it once, then work file by file.
- Unclear mode → ask once: agent-docs / human-docs / adr / codebase-pack / style-pass. No Octocode → host search tools.
- Measuring whether this skill triggers and holds its routes → `octocode-graph-eval`; the runnable sensors here are `scripts/style-lint.mjs --self-test` (rules still fire) and `scripts/refresh-word-list.mjs --dry-run` (word-list drift).
