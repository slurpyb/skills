# Decision Matrix

Load when unsure whether to offload to the local Ollama worker. Why: offload that creates more verify work than it saves is a loss.

Core question: does offloading **free orchestrator context/budget** without creating more verify work than it saves? If no → stay solo.

## Matrix

| Complexity                                        | Volume / tokens | Local tools needed?         | Action                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High (design, security, contested)                | Any             | —                           | Orchestrator only                                                                                 |
| Medium (multi-file edit with judgment)            | Any             | —                           | Orchestrator; optional local draft of _notes_ only                                                |
| Low (summarize, extract, label, draft, translate) | Large           | No                          | **Offload**                                                                                       |
| Low                                               | Small           | No                          | **Offload OK** — prefer warm small/balanced; solo if local cold/slower and user did not ask local |
| Any                                               | Any             | Yes (MCP, shell agent loop) | Orchestrator or host subagent — **not** Ollama worker                                             |

## Complexity signals

| Signal  | Keep on orchestrator (High)                                                           | Local candidate (Low)                                                                                     |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Subject | Architecture / API contracts / auth / tokens; security or privacy-sensitive reasoning | Per-file summaries; field extraction into a fixed schema                                                  |
| Shape   | Root-cause across unknown surfaces; final merge of conflicting evidence               | Labeling tickets/logs with a closed label set; first-pass boilerplate the orchestrator will edit and test |

## Offload ROI check

Offload only if **all** are true:

1. Input is large enough that loading it all into the orchestrator hurts (rough guide: many files or long logs).
2. Output schema is tight enough to verify mechanically.
3. Wrong local answers are cheap to detect (path checks, schema, spot-read).
4. Latency of local + verify is acceptable to the user.

## Prefer non-LLM first

Before any local model call, prefer `rg` / tests / formatters / typecheckers, existing scripts in the repo, or a host "small/fast" cloud model via normal subagent routing when already configured. Local Ollama is for when those are unavailable or the corpus is too large for the orchestrator window.

Next: offload = yes → **ROUTE** with `references/model-selection.md` using **live** `ollama list` and size/capability tiers (named tags in other refs are examples only); surface still unclear → `references/usage-matrix.md`.
