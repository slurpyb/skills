# Ollama Heavy / Cloud Tags

Load when a candidate tag looks too big for the machine, or when reading the sample inventory this skill was dogfooded against. Why: flagship tags are often cloud-only, and one machine’s list is never the contract.

## Often cloud / heavy (local only if you have big iron)

| Model                                                          | Notes                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `qwen3.5:122b`, `397b-cloud`                                   | Flagship Qwen; cloud or multi-GPU                     |
| `qwen3-coder:480b`                                             | ≥250 GB memory claimed for local                      |
| `gpt-oss:120b`                                                 | ~65 GB download class                                 |
| `nemotron-3-super:120b`                                        | MoE 12B active; multi-agent efficiency                |
| `minimax-m2.*` / `m3`, `glm-5.*`, `kimi-k2.*`, `deepseek-v4-*` | Strong coding/agents; many **cloud**-tagged on Ollama |
| `mistral-medium-3.5:128b`                                      | Large dense; workstation+                             |

Use `ollama launch <agent> --model <tag>` with these when cloud is acceptable; do not assume they fit a laptop.

## Appendix — sample inventory from one workstation (not required)

Recorded 2026-07-20 on an author machine (Ollama server ~0.31.x). Other setups will differ — always trust live `ollama list`.

| Example installed tag         | Params    | Context | Capabilities (then)                        |
| ----------------------------- | --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `gemma4:12b`                  | 11.9B     | 262144  | completion, vision, audio, tools, thinking |
| `gemma4:latest`               | 8.0B      | 131072  | completion, vision, audio, tools, thinking |
| `qwen2.5:0.5b` / `7b` / `32b` | 0.5–32.8B | 32768   | completion, tools (no thinking)            |
| `nomic-embed-text`            | 137M      | 2048    | **embedding** only                         |
| `deepseek-ocr`                | 3.3B      | 8192    | completion, vision                         |
| `llama3.2-vision`             | 10.7B     | 131072  | completion, vision, tools                  |
| `gemma3:12b`                  | 12.2B     | 131072  | completion, vision                         |

Always re-run `ollama show <MODEL>` after pull — tags and capabilities change.

Next: local-first capability rows in `references/ollama-local-models-matrix.md`; what fits your RAM in `references/ollama-local-models-kits.md`; evidence links in `references/ollama-local-models-sources.md`.
