Research trail for `octocode-subagent`. Host-agnostic skill; Pi/Cursor/Claude are example hosts only.

## Design choice

Pi-specific tool names were removed so this skill installs on any host. Map `coordinate.md` actions to the local spawn API. Challenge techniques (duck / interview / mimic) live in this skill; KPI measurement stays in `octocode-graph-eval`.
