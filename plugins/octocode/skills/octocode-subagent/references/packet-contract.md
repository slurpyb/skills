# Packet Contract

Load before invoking the local worker. Why: workers inherit no chat history — the packet is the entire world.

**Required fields**

```text
GOAL:           <one sentence>
JOB:            summarize | extract | classify | draft | map | check | vision | translate
MODEL:          <exact name from ollama list>
INPUT:          <paths and/or inline slices; prefer paths + line ranges>
IMAGE:          <optional path for vision jobs>
OUTPUT_SCHEMA:  <JSON schema or bullet fields; be strict>
CONSTRAINTS:
  - no tools, no shell, no web
  - do not invent files, APIs, or line numbers
  - do not generate or invent images (vision = describe provided image only)
  - if unsure, emit null / "unknown" and say why
ACCEPTANCE:
  - <machine-checkable rules>
  - <1–2 spot-check rules for orchestrator>
RETURN:         stdout | file:.octocode/worker/<id>.json
```

## Prompt template (paste into worker)

```text
You are a local worker. Complete only the JOB. Obey CONSTRAINTS.
Return ONLY valid output matching OUTPUT_SCHEMA. No markdown fences unless asked.
GOAL: {{GOAL}}
JOB: {{JOB}}
MODEL: {{MODEL}}
INPUT:
{{INPUT}}
OUTPUT_SCHEMA:
{{OUTPUT_SCHEMA}}
ACCEPTANCE:
{{ACCEPTANCE}}
```

Schema examples (Summarize, Extract, Classify, Translate, Article): `references/packet-schemas.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- Vague goals (“look at the codebase”); asking the worker to “fix”, to “run tests”, or to open/fetch URLs
- Accepting free-form prose when JSON was required; structured jobs without `--format-json` + schema text (+ prefer `--temperature 0.2`)
- Packets larger than the local context window — shard instead (or raise `num_ctx`)
- Skipping local for every small task when a warm model is ready and the user wants local
- Integrating article summaries without quote substring checks

Next: run the packet per `references/ollama-invoke.md`; gate the return with `references/verify-gate.md`.
