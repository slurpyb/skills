# Techniques

Load when quality risk needs a second mind without enlarging the swarm. Why: topology alone misses hidden assumptions, echo chambers, and weak verification (MAST FC2/FC3).

## Catalog → when → load

| Technique                        | When                                                        | Ref                                       |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Rubber duck**                  | Stuck plan; surface assumptions cheaply                     | `references/rubber-duck.md`               |
| **Interview**                    | Another agent’s claims need falsification                   | `references/interview.md`                 |
| **Mimic flow**                   | Worker should follow a playbook without full chat           | `references/mimic-flow.md`                |
| **Red team / devil’s advocate**  | Plan feels “too clean”; attack before ship                  | `references/red-team.md`                  |
| **Premortem**                    | High-stakes change; imagine failure first                   | `references/red-team.md`                  |
| **Steelman**                     | Contested choice; strengthen the opposing case              | `references/red-team.md`                  |
| **Blind review**                 | Critic must judge the artifact, not the author story        | `references/blind-review.md`              |
| **Citation scrub**               | Claims need source locations before publish                 | `references/blind-review.md`              |
| **Consensus / self-consistency** | Ambiguous solve; independent retries then majority          | `references/consensus.md`                 |
| **Round-robin critique**         | Need sequential propose→critique→revise                     | `references/consensus.md`                 |
| **Verifier-critic**              | Quality bottleneck; independent check with anchors          | `references/patterns.md` + fresh context  |
| **Perspective debate**           | Contested product/tech idea (not code claims)               | `octocode-brainstorming` debate.md        |
| **Scout fan-out**                | Breadth-first research; parallel independent angles         | `references/patterns.md` parallel fan-out |
| **Local Ollama offload**         | Save tokens; tool-less one-shot (not a challenge technique) | `references/local-ollama.md`              |

Common topologies (supervisor, plan-and-execute, router, handoffs, pipelines) live in `references/patterns.md` — not duplicated here.

## Hard rules

1. Fresh context for duck / interviewer / critic / red-team — never feed the first worker’s full transcript as “truth.”
2. Parent adjudicates; agreement is **not** proof.
3. One technique at a time unless independence requires parallel critics.
4. Measure usefulness with `octocode-graph-eval` when looping these into a harness.

## Earn the spawn

Prefer parent self-check → rubber duck → interview / red-team → blind review → verifier with anchors → consensus only if still ambiguous. Do not stack by default.

Next: pick one row; spawn → `references/spawn-gate.md` · packets → `references/packets.md`.
