# Model Selection

Load when routing any local offload — every **ROUTE** / model select. Why: only the live inventory says which tag exists, and the smallest fitting one wins.

Portable: works on any `ollama list` — do not assume Gemma, Qwen, or any tag is installed. Load ladder: this file always; `references/family-playbooks.md` only if an installed family needs special flags or two families tie; `references/ollama-local-models.md` only for RAM kits, catalog, MCP/tools matrix, or pull suggestions (ask before pull).

## Absolute rules

1. Run `ollama list` first. Use **exact** listed names (including tags).
2. Never invent or assume a default tag (do not assume `llama3.2` or `gemma4:12b` exists); named tags elsewhere in this skill are **examples**, not requirements.
3. Never use embedding-only models (`*embed*`) as chat/summarize workers, nor OCR/vision-only models for pure-text jobs unless the input needs that modality.
4. Prefer the **smallest** installed chat model that can meet acceptance. Escalate once on verify fail.

## Job → tier (capability, not brand)

| Job pattern                                    | Tier                                       | Why                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Classify / label / short triage                | `small`                                    | Speed; low creativity                          |
| Translate short text                           | `small` or `balanced`                      | Prefer warm; escalate if fidelity fails        |
| Article / web-body summarize (already fetched) | `balanced`                                 | Quote grounding; escalate if grounded_rate < 1 |
| Small one-shot summarize / extract             | `small` if warm + simple; else `balanced`  | Latency for tiny jobs                          |
| Summarize, extract JSON, checklist             | `balanced`                                 | Instruction following + structure              |
| Draft code / tests                             | `balanced` (prefer coder/instruct signals) | Code structure                                 |
| Hard local synthesis (rare, still allowlisted) | `strong`                                   | Else keep on orchestrator                      |
| Image caption / OCR                            | `special`                                  | Needs vision / OCR capability                  |

**Bucket installed models** — after `ollama list`, optionally `ollama show <name>` (confirm ambiguous `parameters`, `context length`, capabilities). Bucket by **signals**:

| Signal                                                | Bucket                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `embed` / embedding-only capability                   | **skip** for workers                                      |
| `ocr` in name, or OCR-specialized                     | `special` (OCR jobs only)                                 |
| `vision` capability + image input                     | `special` for vision; also usable as text if chat-capable |
| params / name ≤ ~3B (`0.5b`, `1b`, `2b`, `3b`, `e2b`) | `small`                                                   |
| ~4B–14B (`7b`, `8b`, `9b`, `12b`, mid `latest`)       | `balanced`                                                |
| ~20B+ (`26b`, `27b`, `30b`, `31b`, `32b`, `70b`)      | `strong`                                                  |
| `coder` / code-focused name                           | prefer for `draft` when in tier                           |
| `thinking` capability                                 | OK; default **think off** for bulk                        |

Ties: prefer already-warm (`ollama ps`) at the same tier; structured-output models (many Qwen/instruct tags) for JSON/extract/classify **if installed**; coder or strong instruct for draft/code; any `vision`/multimodal for images; newer family generation over older sibling **when both installed** (e.g. gemma4 over gemma3) as the last tie-break. Illustrative only: on a Gemma + Qwen mix, tiny Qwen → classify, mid Qwen → JSON, mid Gemma → draft/vision, large anything → cascade. **Recompute from the live list every session.**

**Algorithm:** tier = f(job pattern) → candidates = installed chat models in tier ∪ stronger → drop embed / wrong-modality → optional family tie-break → pick the smallest remaining that meets structure needs → none left ⇒ solo, and suggest a size class to pull (ask user) → `export OLLAMA_WORKER_MODEL=<exact name from list>` → thinking-capable ⇒ default `--think=false` for bulk.

- **Cascade:** on verify `fail` → next stronger installed chat model, else orchestrator solo.
- **Hardware:** slow/thrashing → drop tier or shrink shards; JSON fail on tiny model → cascade once; prefer smaller download/params that passes verify.
- **Report:** `model=<exact> tier=<t> reason=<smallest fit | warm | cascade | solo> think=<on|off>`

Next: invoke with `references/ollama-invoke.md`; family flags or tie-break examples in `references/family-playbooks.md`; gate the return with `references/verify-gate.md`.
