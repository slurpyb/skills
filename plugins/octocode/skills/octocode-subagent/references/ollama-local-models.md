# Ollama local models for developers

Load when the question is RAM / kit advice, catalog browse, MCP/tools capability, or pull recommendations — **not** routine ROUTE / model select (that is `references/model-selection.md`, portable tiers). Why: this is a catalog, not a required install list.

Choosing Ollama models on a laptop/workstation: RAM kits, capability matrix (thinking, tools, context, vision), and how that maps to MCP / Agent Skills / coding agents.

**Authority:** Ollama library tags + `ollama show` on _the current machine_. Community blogs are secondary. Re-check live tags before pulling. **Pull gate:** NEVER `ollama pull` multi-GB models unless the user explicitly asks — suggest a size/class and wait for approval.

## Layer map (do not confuse these)

| Layer              | What it is                                       | Who provides it                            | Model requirement                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Completion**     | Chat / generate text                             | Model weights                              | Always                                                   |
| **Tools**          | Native function calling                          | Model + Ollama engine                      | `tools` in `ollama show` / library tag                   |
| **Thinking**       | Explicit chain-of-thought channel                | Model + `--think` / API                    | `thinking` capability                                    |
| **Vision / audio** | Image (and sometimes audio) in                   | Multimodal models                          | `vision` / `audio`                                       |
| **MCP**            | Tool servers over Model Context Protocol         | Host (Cursor, Claude Code, mcp-host, etc.) | Model must support **tools**; MCP is not a model feature |
| **Agent Skills**   | `SKILL.md` instruction packs                     | Host agent / skill loader                  | Works with any chat model; quality follows model         |
| **Coding agents**  | Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex via `ollama launch` | Ollama app + agent harness                 | Prefer **tools + long context**; thinking optional       |
| **Embeddings**     | Vectors for RAG                                  | Embed-only models                          | **Never** use as chat/coder                              |

This skill’s local worker is **single-shot text** (no tool loops). For MCP / agent loops, use a tools-capable model in the **host** agent, not the worker packet path.

## Reading any machine — run `ollama show <MODEL>` and map

| Field                            | Use                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `parameters`                     | Size → small / balanced / strong                        |
| `context length`                 | Shard sizing; prefer longer ctx for big files           |
| `Capabilities: embedding`        | Never as chat worker                                    |
| `Capabilities: vision` / `audio` | Modality jobs                                           |
| `Capabilities: tools`            | Host MCP/agent loops — **not** this skill’s worker path |
| `Capabilities: thinking`         | Default off for bulk (`--think=false`)                  |

## MCP, Skills, and coding agents — practical rules

1. **MCP works when the model has `tools`.** The MCP server list lives in the host (e.g. Cursor MCP, this repo’s mcp-host). Model choice does not install MCP; it only enables calling tools reliably.
2. **Agent Skills (`SKILL.md`) are host instructions**, not model weights. A stronger tools+thinking model follows skills better; a tiny model may ignore complex skill flows.
3. **Local worker skill ≠ MCP agent.** The local Ollama path (`references/local-ollama.md`) forbids tool loops on the worker. Keep MCP/tool agents on the orchestrator (or `ollama launch` coding apps).
4. **Thinking:** default **off** for bulk/classify/JSON (`--think=false`). On for hard reasoning, North Mini Code-style agents, and deepseek-r1.
5. **Context:** prefer ≥128K for repo work. Avoid 32K-era models (`qwen2.5-coder`, older codestral) for large codebases unless shards are tiny.
6. **Apple Silicon:** prefer MLX tags + recent Ollama (≥0.31) for Gemma 4 speedups with coding agents.
