# CDP Observation Patterns

Load for passive evidence collection. Why: listeners must be attached before navigation/action.

## Network Console

Enable Network, Runtime, and Log first. Capture failed requests, non-2xx/3xx statuses of interest, console errors, exceptions, and source locations.

## Performance Audit

Start before navigation; collect navigation/resource timing, long tasks, metrics, and bounded trace data only when needed.

## Core Web Vitals

Inject observers before navigation when possible. Feature-detect PerformanceObserver and emit missing-support as uncertainty.

## DOM Accessibility

Use Accessibility tree plus DOM role/name/label checks. Report selectors and impact; avoid generic dumps.

## Heap Memory

`HeapProfiler.enable` + `HeapProfiler.takeHeapSnapshot`, collecting chunks via `HeapProfiler.addHeapSnapshotChunk`. Compare before/after action only when a leak hypothesis exists.

## Security Audit

Enable `Security`/`Audits` and attach listeners before navigation, same as Network/Console. What to inspect: `references/intents-inspect.md#security`; exact methods: `references/cdp-domain-map.md`.

Next: recovery table in `references/recovery.md` when signals conflict or disappear.
