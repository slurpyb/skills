# CDP Auth Intents

Load for login, MFA, CAPTCHA, real-profile, or cookie transfer. Why: authenticated CDP exposes sensitive state.

## login

Open visible Chrome; let the user authenticate. Do not automate password/MFA unless explicitly approved.

## user-auth

Emit `[AUTH_COMPLETE]` only on a deterministic post-auth signal; else `[AUTH_TIMEOUT]` with observed URL/state.

## Real Profile Gate

Before `--profile`, warn CDP can read cookies, tokens, storage, and page data. Require explicit yes.

## Cookie Bridge

When the user wants default-browser cookies in an isolated headless session, load `references/cookie-bridge.md` and run `scripts/cookie-bridge.mjs` with `--i-understand-secrets`. Prefer storageState or `--from-port` over `--from-profile` if Chrome is already open.

`--from-profile` needs Chrome fully quit first: the profile directory is locked to one running instance, so `open-browser.mjs`/`cookie-bridge.mjs` cannot read the real profile while the user's own Chrome still holds it open — they silently fall back to an isolated, cookie-less profile instead. This skill has no way to attach to an already-open, already-logged-in Chrome window without relaunching it; that would need a browser-extension transport (`chrome.debugger`) outside this skill's scope. If the task needs the user's live session left running rather than its cookies copied, check whether a Chrome-extension automation tool is already available in the environment before building one here.

## Follow-up

After auth/inject, run the smallest debug/scrape script on the same `--to-port` with `--keep-tab`; do not navigate unless asked. Never print secret values.

Next: storage safety in `references/intents-storage.md`; launch flags in `references/chrome-flags.md`.
