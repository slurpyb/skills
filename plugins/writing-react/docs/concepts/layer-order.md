title: "Layer Order"
---

The cascade layers are applied in the following order:

- `@layer utilities` (Highest priority)
- `@layer recipes`
- `@layer tokens`
- `@layer base`
- `@layer reset` (Lowest priority)

This means that styles defined in the `@layer utilities` will take precedence over styles defined in the
`@layer recipes`. This is useful when you want to override the default styles of a component.
