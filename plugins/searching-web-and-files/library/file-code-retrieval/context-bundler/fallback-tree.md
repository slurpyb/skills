# Procedural Fallback Tree: Context Bundler (Markdown)

## 1. File Not Found During Aggregation
If the agent attempts to read a file specified by the user and it does not exist:
- **Action**: Insert the explicit failure placeholder (`🔴 **NOT INCLUDED**`) into the Markdown bundle for that specific file path. Continue aggregating the rest of the files. Do NOT halt the entire bundling process.

## 2. File Unreadable (Permissions/Encoding)
If `view_file` or `cat` fails on a binary or permission-locked file:
- **Action**: Treat it exactly like a missing file. Insert the failure placeholder explaining that the file could not be read. Continue processing.

## 3. Bundle Exceeds Target Size (e.g. Output Too Large)
If compiling the bundle results in a massive Markdown file that exceeds output limits or takes too long to generate:
- **Action**: STOP. Report to the user that the requested bundle size is unmanageable as a single Markdown file. Suggest switching to `zip-bundling` or explicitly removing broad directories from the index.

## 4. User Provides Vague Request
If the user says "bundle the logic" without specifying files:
- **Action**: Perform a quick codebase search to identify 3-5 high-value files (e.g., `main.py`, standard architecture docs). Present the proposed manifest to the user for confirmation BEFORE generating the bundle.
