## 1. How MCP Integrations Work

### What Is MCP?

MCP stands for **Model Context Protocol**. It is the standard that allows Claude to connect to external data sources and services during a session. When an MCP server is configured, Claude can read from and write to that service on your behalf, using your credentials, in real time.

In practical terms: instead of you manually pulling a GA4 report, pasting it into the conversation, and asking Claude to analyze it, the GA4 MCP server lets Claude pull that data directly. You ask a question, Claude fetches the numbers, and you get an answer grounded in your real data.

### How the Plugin Uses MCP

The plugin ships with a `.mcp.json` configuration file that defines 68 MCP server connections. Each one maps to a marketing platform or productivity tool. None of them are active by default. They activate only when you set the required environment variables for that service.

This is the key design principle: **the plugin works fully without any integrations enabled.** All 16 skill modules, 170+ reference knowledge files (148 v2.x + 23 v3.0 methodology + framework refs), scoring scripts, brand voice analysis, compliance checking, campaign planning features, and the v3.0 12-Part engagement methodology + v3.2 quality gates operate entirely offline using built-in benchmarks and reference data. MCP integrations layer real data on top of that foundation.

### What Happens Under the Hood

1. When Claude Code starts a session, it reads `.mcp.json` and attempts to start each configured MCP server.
2. If the required environment variables for a server are set, the server starts and Claude gains access to that platform's data.
3. If the variables are missing, the server silently skips. No errors, no broken functionality.
4. During the session, when a module needs data (for example, the `analytics-insights` module building a performance report), it checks whether the relevant MCP connection is available. If it is, it pulls real data. If not, it falls back to industry benchmarks from `industry-profiles.md`.

### Where Credentials Live

All API keys and credentials are stored exclusively in **environment variables** on your machine. Nothing is hardcoded in the plugin. Nothing is written to plugin data files. The `.mcp.json` file references variables using `${VARIABLE_NAME}` syntax, and those values are resolved from your environment at runtime.

No data is sent to third parties beyond the direct MCP server connections you configure. Each MCP server runs locally on your machine and connects directly to the service API.

## 2. Setting Up Your First Integration

The following walkthrough uses Google Analytics 4 as a worked example. The same pattern applies to every integration in the plugin.

### Step 1: Get Your Credentials

You need two things for GA4:

- **GA4 Property ID**: Found in Google Analytics under Admin > Property Settings. It is a numeric ID (e.g., `123456789`).
- **Google Application Credentials**: A service account JSON key file from Google Cloud Console. Go to APIs & Services > Credentials > Create Credentials > Service Account. Generate a JSON key and download it. Then grant this service account "Viewer" access to your GA4 property.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

Set these before launching Claude Code. How you do this depends on your operating system.

**macOS / Linux (terminal)**

```bash
export GA_PROPERTY_ID="123456789"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/Users/you/keys/ga4-service-account.json"
```

To make these persist across sessions, add them to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or `~/.bash_profile`.

**Windows (Command Prompt)**

```cmd
set GA_PROPERTY_ID=123456789
set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=C:\Users\you\keys\ga4-service-account.json
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
$env:GA_PROPERTY_ID = "123456789"
$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS = "C:\Users\you\keys\ga4-service-account.json"
```

To make these persist on Windows, set them as System or User environment variables via System Properties > Environment Variables.

### Step 3: Verify the Connection

Start Claude Code and ask something that would require GA4 data:

```
You: Pull my website traffic data for the last 30 days
```

- **If GA4 MCP is configured:** Claude pulls real sessions, pageviews, conversion data, and traffic sources directly from your property.
- **If GA4 MCP is not configured:** Claude tells you the integration is not available and uses industry benchmarks from `industry-profiles.md` (covering 22 industries) to provide estimated ranges instead.

### Step 4: What Changes When the Integration Is Active

With GA4 connected, the following plugin capabilities upgrade from benchmark-based to data-driven:

| Capability | Without GA4 | With GA4 |
|---|---|---|
| Performance reports | Industry benchmark ranges | Your actual traffic and conversion numbers |
| Anomaly detection | Not available | Flags unusual spikes or drops in your metrics |
| Campaign post-mortems | Generic framework | References your real conversion data and attribution |
| KPI tracking | Suggested targets based on industry | Tracks against your actual historical performance |
| Audience intelligence | Persona-based assumptions | Real demographic and behavioral data from your visitors |

## 4. Multi-CRM Setup for Agencies

### The Challenge

The `.mcp.json` file supports a single set of credentials per MCP server. If you manage one brand, this is straightforward. But agencies managing multiple clients -- each with their own HubSpot portal, their own GA4 property, their own Meta ad account -- run into a credential management challenge.

### v2.0.0 Credential Profiles

v2.0.0 introduces `/digital-marketing-pro:credential-switch`, which manages per-brand credential profiles stored at `~/.claude-marketing/credentials/`. Each brand maps to its own set of platform environment variable names, so when you switch brands, the plugin knows which credentials belong to which client.

The credential manager (`credential-manager.py`) stores a JSON mapping for each brand slug:

```json
{
  "brand_slug": "acme-corp",
  "profiles": {
    "google-analytics": {"GA_PROPERTY_ID": "111111111"},
    "hubspot": {"HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN": "pat-na1-acme-token"},
    "mailchimp": {"MAILCHIMP_API_KEY": "abc123-us14"}
  }
}
```

When you run `/digital-marketing-pro:credential-switch acme-corp`, the plugin loads the corresponding credential profile and maps the environment variables for that brand's platforms. The actual credential values still need to be set as environment variables on your machine, but the mapping between brand and credential set is now managed automatically.

This eliminates the manual juggling of previous versions. You still have the option of using the patterns below as supplementary approaches for advanced setups.

---

### Pattern A: Environment Variable Swapping

The simplest approach. Manually change the environment variables before starting work on a different client.

```bash
# Working on Client A (their GA4 property, their HubSpot portal)
export GA_PROPERTY_ID="111111111"
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pat-na1-client-a-token"

# Switching to Client B
export GA_PROPERTY_ID="222222222"
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pat-na1-client-b-token"
```

**Best for:** Agencies with 2-3 clients on the same platforms. Quick to execute, nothing to maintain beyond the credential values themselves.

**Limitation:** Requires restarting Claude Code after changing environment variables for MCP servers to pick up the new values.

---

### Pattern B: Multiple .mcp.json Files

Maintain separate MCP configuration files per client and swap the active one.

```bash
# One-time setup: create per-client configs
cp .mcp.json .mcp-acme-corp.json      # Edit with Acme Corp's credentials
cp .mcp.json .mcp-techflow.json        # Edit with TechFlow's credentials
cp .mcp.json .mcp-greenleaf.json       # Edit with GreenLeaf's credentials

# Before starting a session for Acme Corp
cp .mcp-acme-corp.json .mcp.json

# Before starting a session for TechFlow
cp .mcp-techflow.json .mcp.json
```

**Best for:** Agencies with clients on different platform combinations. One client might use GA4 + HubSpot + Mailchimp while another uses GA4 + Stripe + Slack. Each `.mcp.json` file can have a different set of servers enabled.

**Limitation:** Requires file swap and Claude Code restart between clients.

---

### Pattern C: CRM-Agnostic Workflow (No Live Connection)

Skip MCP entirely for CRM data. Export from whatever CRM the client uses and bring the data into the session manually.

```
You: Here is our client's pipeline data exported from Salesforce:

Stage            | Count | Avg Value | Avg Days
Qualification    | 45    | $12,000   | 8
Proposal         | 23    | $18,500   | 14
Negotiation      | 11    | $25,000   | 22
Closed Won       | 8     | $27,000   | 31

Analyze this pipeline and create a nurture campaign targeting deals stuck in Negotiation for more than 20 days.
```

**Best for:** Clients on CRMs that do not have MCP server support (Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, Close, Monday CRM, etc.). Also useful when a client is unwilling to provide API credentials and prefers to share exports.

**Trade-off:** You lose the real-time query capability (Claude cannot pull fresh data mid-conversation), but all analysis, planning, and content creation modules work the same way once the data is in the session.

---

### Pattern D: Per-Session Configuration

Create shell scripts that set all environment variables for a specific client, then launch Claude Code.

```bash
# File: clients/acme-corp/env.sh
export GA_PROPERTY_ID="111111111"
export GSC_SITE_URL="https://acmecorp.com"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/keys/acme-corp-sa.json"
export HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN="pat-na1-acme-token"
export MAILCHIMP_API_KEY="abc123def456-us14"
export SLACK_BOT_TOKEN="xoxb-acme-slack-token"

# File: clients/techflow/env.sh
export GA_PROPERTY_ID="222222222"
export GSC_SITE_URL="https://techflow.io"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/keys/techflow-sa.json"
export META_ACCESS_TOKEN="EAAxxxxxxxx"
export META_AD_ACCOUNT_ID="act_987654321"
export STRIPE_API_KEY="rk_live_techflow_restricted_key"
```

Usage:

```bash
# Start a session for Acme Corp
source ./clients/acme-corp/env.sh && claude

# Start a session for TechFlow
source ./clients/techflow/env.sh && claude
```

**Best for:** Agencies that want clean, repeatable separation between client sessions. Each session starts with a known-good credential set. Combine this with `/digital-marketing-pro:switch-brand` at session start to load the matching brand profile.

**Security note:** Store these env files outside of version control. Add `clients/*/env.sh` to your `.gitignore`.

## 5. What Works Without Integrations

The plugin is designed to be fully functional with zero MCP connections enabled. Here is what the offline baseline includes:

### Always Available (No Integrations Required)

| Capability | What Powers It |
|---|---|
| Content creation (briefs, calendars, social posts, email sequences) | 16 skill modules + `platform-specs.md` (format specs for 15+ platforms) |
| Brand voice scoring | `brand-voice-scorer.py` + local brand profile |
| Content quality scoring | `content-scorer.py` + `scoring-rubrics.md` |
| Campaign planning and strategy | Skill modules + `industry-profiles.md` (22 industries) |
| Compliance checking | `compliance-rules.md` (16 jurisdictions including GDPR, CCPA, CAN-SPAM, CASL) |
| AEO/GEO optimization | `aeo-audit` and `aeo-geo` modules with built-in optimization frameworks |
| Competitor analysis frameworks | `competitor-analysis` module (manual input of competitor data) |
| Crisis communication | `crisis-response` module with response templates and escalation frameworks |
| Funnel architecture and audits | `funnel-architect` and `funnel-audit` modules |
| Landing page audits | `landing-page-audit` module with CRO heuristics |
| Influencer briefs | `influencer-brief` and `influencer-creator` modules |
| Brand setup and switching | `brand-setup` and `switch-brand` skills |
| Campaign memory and tracking | `campaign-tracker.py` (local persistent storage) |

### Significantly Enhanced by Integrations

These capabilities work offline but deliver substantially more value with live data:

| Capability | Without Integration | With Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **Performance reports** | Framework with industry benchmarks | Real metrics from GA4, GSC, ad platforms |
| **Anomaly detection** | Not possible (no data to monitor) | Flags unusual changes in traffic, conversions, spend |
| **Competitive keyword intelligence** | Manual input only | SEMrush/Ahrefs pull live keyword and backlink data |
| **CRM-driven campaigns** | You provide pipeline data manually | HubSpot feeds real contact and deal data |
| **Revenue attribution** | Estimated based on industry benchmarks | Stripe provides actual revenue and conversion data |
| **Automated reporting** | Reports generated in-session | Sheets export + Slack delivery to stakeholders |
| **Email performance optimization** | Best practices and frameworks | Mailchimp provides real open/click/bounce data |
| **Ad platform optimization** | General recommendations | Platform-specific data from Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn |

### Recommended Starting Configuration

If you are setting up integrations for the first time, this priority order gives you the most value per effort:

1. **Google Analytics 4** -- Unlocks real performance data across almost every module
2. **Google Search Console** -- Pairs with GA4 for complete organic search visibility
3. **Your primary ad platform** (Google Ads, Meta, or LinkedIn) -- Whichever you spend the most on
4. **Your CRM** (HubSpot) -- Connects campaign planning to real pipeline data
5. **Google Sheets** -- Enables export and sharing of reports with stakeholders
6. **Everything else** -- Add as needed based on your workflow

---

## 6. Data Privacy & Security

### Credential Storage

- All API keys and credentials are stored exclusively in **environment variables** on your local machine
- The `.mcp.json` file contains only variable references (`${VARIABLE_NAME}`), never actual credential values
- No credentials are stored in plugin code, plugin data files, brand profiles, or campaign tracking data
- The plugin never writes credentials to disk, logs, or temporary files

### Data Flow

- Each MCP server runs as a local process on your machine
- Data flows directly from your machine to the service API (e.g., your machine to Google Analytics API)
- Data is not routed through Anthropic's servers, the plugin author's servers, or any third party
- Query results are used within your Claude Code session and are subject to Claude Code's standard data handling

### Client Data Isolation

- Each brand's data is stored in its own directory under `~/.claude-marketing/brands/`
- Brand profiles, campaign history, and scoring data are fully isolated at the file system level
- There is no cross-client data leakage through the plugin
- The `switch-brand` skill loads only the selected brand's data into the session context

### Agency Security Recommendations

For agencies managing multiple client accounts:

1. **Use restricted/read-only API keys wherever possible.** Stripe, Google Ads, and most platforms support restricted keys with specific permission scopes. Only grant the access the plugin actually needs.

2. **Use separate environment variable files per client** (Pattern D from Section 4). Never store multiple clients' credentials in the same shell profile.

3. **Add credential files to .gitignore.** If you version-control your agency configuration, ensure env files and service account JSON keys are excluded.

4. **Rotate credentials on a schedule.** When an analyst leaves the team or a client relationship ends, rotate the affected API keys.

5. **Audit which integrations are active.** Not every client engagement needs every integration. Enable only what each project requires.

6. **Keep service account JSON files in a secure location.** Use a dedicated directory with restricted file permissions, not your Downloads folder or Desktop.

### Compliance Considerations

When connecting MCP integrations that access personal data (especially GA4, HubSpot, Meta, and Mailchimp), ensure that:

- Your use of Claude Code with these data sources is covered by your organization's data processing agreements
- You have appropriate consent or legal basis for processing the personal data accessed through these integrations
- The data handling aligns with the compliance rules applicable to your clients' jurisdictions (see `compliance-rules.md` for rules covering 16 jurisdictions including GDPR, CCPA, LGPD, PIPEDA, and more)
- You maintain records of which integrations are enabled and what data they access, per your internal data governance policies
