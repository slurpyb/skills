## Nested Classes

**Impact: LOW (Encapsulation)**

Nested classes are fine when the class is an implementation detail of the outer class.
Use them to group related functionality that shouldn't be exposed globally.

**Correct:**

```python
class Outer:
    class _Inner:  # Private inner class
        pass
```
