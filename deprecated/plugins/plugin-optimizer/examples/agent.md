# Agent Template

**Purpose**: Autonomous specialist with isolated context.

**Frontmatter Requirements**:
```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: |
  Expert agent for [primary purpose and domain].

  <example>
  Context: [Brief context describing the user's intent]
  user: "[User's request or command]"
  assistant: "I'll launch the agent-name agent to [describe what the agent will do], [key actions], and [expected outcome]."
  <commentary>
  [Explanation of why this example matches the agent's purpose and what makes it appropriate]
  </commentary>
  </example>

  <example>
  Context: [Alternative context showing different use case]
  user: "[Different user request]"
  assistant: "I'll launch the agent-name agent to [describe actions], [key steps], and [expected result]."
  <commentary>
  [Explanation of this alternative scenario and how it demonstrates agent capabilities]
  </commentary>
  </example>
  
  Note: Examples are completely optional and can be omitted if not needed.

- Use descriptive voice: "You are an expert...", "You analyze..."
- Focus on capabilities and responsibilities (what agent CAN do)
- Never use directive instructions: avoid "Load...", "Execute steps..."

**Structure Requirements**:
- System prompt in second person: "You are..."
- "## Knowledge Base" section (skills loaded)
- "## Core Responsibilities" section (numbered list)
- "## Approach" section (principles and working style)

**Complete Template**:
